    <h1>Dominik Kawka's Assessment Website</h1>
    <p>This is the home page for my first assessment website for my website development module</p>

    <ul>
        <li>My music taste</li>
        <li>My small minecraft hardcore project</li>
        <li>Previous experience with code</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As this is the home page, I guess I'll talk a little about myself and where I'm from.</p>

    <p>My name is Dominik Kawka, I was born on the 2nd of August,2002 in Poland. Although I don't remember much, 
    I lived in the countryside with my parents, frequently visiting my grandparents while they went out working.
    Before I even went to kindergarten, my father moved to Ireland in search for working, with me and my mom following shortly after.</p>
    <p>Ever since I've been living in Ireland, only coming back to Poland for an occasional visit to family. I have little desire to return
    since I see Ireland more as a home than Poland since all the friends I made were made in Ireland, and not having any connections in Poland other than close family.
    </p>
    <p>For my primary school, I went to Waterford Educate Together. In there I met Frank, who is also doing this course. We became friends very quickly and have stuck around,
    even after primary school because we live really close to each other. He's the only person I talk to frequently from my primary. We split off in secondary, with me going to
    Mount Sion C.B.S.
    </p>
    <p>A lot of people were from the Mount Sion primary school already, so it was kind of hard to make new friendships at first, but throughout the 6 years in secondary I was able
    to become close friends with a few people in my class. Although we went off to do our own different courses, we still talk daily via group chats and group calls.
