    <h1>My coding experience</h1>
    <p>I was interested in computing from a very young age. I would always sit inside and play games or mess around with various software on my computer</p>
    <p>I've always dabbled a tiny amount of code here and there, but I never really committed or I didn't spend a lot of time on it in general, however in Transition Year 
    I got an oppertuinity, along with some of my other classmates to work at <em>Red Hat Waterford</em> as an intern. In this internship we mainly dabbled in:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>git</li>
        <li>Basic JavaScript</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After working at the internship for 6 months, I was moved to the TSSG to work with LiquidEdge as an intern. Here I delved into the basics MEAN stack development.</p>
    <p>During this internship my school asked me and my red hat classmates to develop a new site for our school together. Here is the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/MountSionCBSSecondary/SchoolWebsite" target="_blank">github page</a> for the website</p>
    <p>After transition year; a new subject was introducted to the Leaving Cert and my school was the lucky 1 of 40 schools in Ireland to have it. 
        That subject was computer science. A lot of things that I learned from my internships were repeated in computer science, however I still learned a lot of new things.
        I started using python and got to learn a lot about the theory of computing. I ended up with a H2 in Computer Science from the predicted grading.</p>
    <p>Now I am in my first semester of System Software Development at the Waterford Institute of Technology. A lot of the things I learned before are still carrying me throughout the course right now, 
        however I know that I can't relax or skip classes because soon enough we will be moving onto new grounds that I haven't explored during my internships.</p>
